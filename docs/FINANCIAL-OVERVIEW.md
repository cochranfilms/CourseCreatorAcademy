# Platform Financial Overview

This document outlines the financial commitments for building and operating the Course Creator Academy platform. Please read through this carefully so we're both on the same page about costs.

## Current Monthly Expenses (Right Now)

Here's what we're currently paying each month:

- **Vercel Hosting**: $20/month total
  - $10 of this is allocated to CCA
  
- **Cursor Development Tool**: $20/month base + approximately $60/month for development usage
  - Currently, about $60 of this is going toward CCA development
  
- **Google Drive Storage**: $10/month

**Current Total**: Approximately $80/month for CCA-related expenses

## Development Phase Costs (Next 2 Months)

To finish building the app, we need to invest more in development tools. Here's what we expect:

- **Cursor Development Tool**: Additional $60-$75/month investment needed
- **Vercel Hosting**: $10/month (continuing)
- **Google Drive Storage**: $10/month (continuing)

**Total Expected Monthly Cost**: $90-$100/month during development

**Split Between Both Parties**: $50/month per person (to keep it simple)

**Important Note**: During this development phase, we may need to ask for an additional $10-$20 from either party if unexpected costs come up. This is normal during active development.

## Ongoing Costs (After Development is Complete)

Once the app is built and running, here are the regular monthly costs we'll need to cover:

### Fixed Monthly Costs:
- **Vercel Hosting**: $10/month
- **Google Drive Storage**: $10/month

### Variable Costs (Pay-As-You-Go):
- **Firebase BLAZE Plan**: This is a pay-as-you-go plan, meaning you only pay for what you use.

  **What Firebase BLAZE Plan Includes:**
  - **Free Tier**: Firebase provides generous free usage quotas for most services
  - **After Free Tier**: Costs are based on actual usage:
    - **Firestore Database**: 
      - $0.18 per 100,000 document reads
      - $0.18 per 100,000 document writes
      - $0.02 per 100,000 document deletes
    - **Cloud Functions**: 
      - Free for first 2 million invocations per month
      - $0.40 per million invocations after that
    - **Firebase Storage**: 
      - $0.026 per GB stored per month
      - $0.12 per GB downloaded
    - **Firebase Authentication**: 
      - Free for unlimited users
  
  **Estimated Monthly Cost**: For a small to medium-sized platform, Firebase costs typically range from $0-$50/month depending on traffic and usage. We'll monitor this closely and set up budget alerts to avoid surprises.

**Total Ongoing Monthly Cost**: Approximately $20-$80/month (depending on Firebase usage)

## Important Notes

### This is a Joint Investment

Both of us are investing in this platform:
- **Cody** is investing his time, energy, and technical skills to build the platform
- **Both parties** are sharing the financial costs

### Financial Transparency

We want to make sure everything is clear and understood upfront. If you have any questions about these costs, please ask. We're in this together.

### Flexibility During Development

During the active development phase (next 2 months), we may need to be flexible. If we need an additional $10-$20 from either party to cover unexpected development costs, we'll communicate that clearly and work together to make it happen.

---

## Summary

**Development Phase (Next 2 Months):**
- Each person: **$50/month**
- May need additional $10-$20 if unexpected costs arise

**After Development:**
- Shared costs: **$20-$80/month** (depending on platform usage)
- Costs will be split fairly based on actual expenses
